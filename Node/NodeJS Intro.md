So NodeJS is C++ application which has a V8 engine(developed by google) which execute JS and on top it it has some super powers like APIs (eg: API to  connect to DB) and modules.

We have a global object which is not the part of V8 engine but one of the super power given to us by Node JS, this global object has many methods, like setTimeout, setInterval, etc

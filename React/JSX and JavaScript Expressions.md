JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like structures within your JavaScript code. To embed JavaScript expressions within JSX, including variables, function calls, or template literals, you must wrap them in curly braces {}. Template Literals as JavaScript Expressions: Backticks are used to define template literals in JavaScript, which allow for string interpolation using ${}. Since template literals are a feature of JavaScript, they need to be treated as JavaScript expressions when used within JSX. Attributes as Strings (Default): When you provide a value to a JSX attribute without curly braces, it is treated as a plain string literal. For example, className="my-class" assigns the string "my-class" to the className attribute. If you were to write className=my-class`` without curly braces, JSX would interpret the backticks as part of the literal string, not as a JavaScript templateÂ literal.

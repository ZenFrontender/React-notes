The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) states that a class or module  should do only one thing or represent one responsibility. 
In React, this means each component should be implementing or making a particular UI logic, making your code easier to understand, maintain, and test.
Eg: Header component shall only be used to implement header into our application.
